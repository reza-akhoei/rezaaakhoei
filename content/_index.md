description: I am a statistician and data analyst. I am passionate about data and
  love to extract insightful information from each type of data and turn them into
  *wisdom*. In this way, the main tool for me is **R programming language**. *R* is
  like the languages I speak. However, most of statistical topics covers data science
  field and each statistician can be a data scientist; yet I would rather call myself
  a data student. Because it reminds me that I must be always in learning.
