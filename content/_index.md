description: I am a statistician and data analyst. I love to extract insightful information from each type of data and turn them into wisdom. The main tool in this way for me is **R programming language**. *R* is like the languages I speak. However, Most of statistical topics covers data science field and each statistician can be a data scientist; yet I would rather call myself a data student. Because it reminds me I must be always in learning.
