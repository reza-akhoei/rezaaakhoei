intro: "My name is Reza Ali Akbari Khoei (Reza A.A. Khoei). You can abbreviately
  call me Reza Khoei. I have PhD in **Biostatistics**. 
  My Master's thesis was entitled **Application of Cure Models in thalassemia major disease**. I fitted different Cure Survival models on thalassemia major disease and tried to find some appropriate models to fit on these dataset.
  My dissertation was entitled **Bayesian Approach in Zero-inflated Double Poisson Models and its Application in Medical Data**. 
Using Bayesian approach, I extended hurdle and zero-inflated double poisson models to **multilevel approach** and used it for analysis of **neonate data** and evaluation of related risk factors on congenital anomalies of newborns. \n\n I had no idea about creating websites till I found out that it is possible using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). This
  fact made me motivated to create my own blog and got started blogging about what I've 
  learned and what I think can be useful for others.
  
  
  \n This blog is built using 
  [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.org/) amazing blogdown package in 
  [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
  for all *R* lovers. Besides, it is generated and deployed 
  using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
